Welcome to The SpokenWeb at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. This site features literary sound events dating from 1957-1988 and recorded on reel-to-reel and cassette tape recorders in our region. The site features some of those recordings, and will direct you to further resources held in our repository and curated by institutions across the SpokenWeb network.

The audio textual items in this collection are housed at The University of Alberta and made available through [UAlberta Library's Aviary Online Collection](https://ualberta.aviaryplatform.com/).
