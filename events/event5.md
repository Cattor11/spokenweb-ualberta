**The Department of English and Film Studies is delighted to welcome Ifeoma Chinwuba, Writer in Residence 2021-22, for a pair of events celebrating her new novel, Sons of the East, published this year by Griots Lounge. Ifeoma is an award-winning writer, whose books include Merchants of Flesh (ANA Prose Prize 2004) Fearless, Waiting for Maria (ANA Prose Prize 2008; longlist of Commonwealth Writers Prize 2008). African Romance (2013) and Head Boy (2019). During her tenure as Writer in Residence at the University of Alberta, Ifeoma edited "The Pandemic And Me," a collection of short stories from different writers, and wrote Sons of the East, a novel focused on an entrepreneurial Igbo family "beset by rivalry, chauvinism, and infidelity," and a work that is already receiving glowing reviews.

These events are supported by the Department of English and Film Studies and by SpokenWeb.
