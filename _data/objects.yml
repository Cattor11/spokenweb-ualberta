      Jeni Couzin, Humanities Centre, University of Alberta, AV L-3, Thursday December
      2nd 1976, 12:30 noon. Jeni Couzin was born in South Africa, spent ten years
      in Britain, and has recently settled in Canada. She was one of the founding
      members of Poets'' Conference and Poets'' Union in Britain, and was an influential
      figure in the formation of public reading series in England. She is the author
      of three books of poetry, all of which were well received: Flying (Workshop
      Press), Monkey''s Wedding (Cape), and the recent Christmas in Africa (J.J. Douglas,
      Vancouver, &amp; Heinemann, London). Some of the critical praise for Christmas
      in Africa: "One is grateful to a poet who can recover for the modern reader
      the authentic and mythopoetic voice" -- Rosemary Sullivan, CVII. "She sings
      and curses, applauds and deplores the conditions of humanity in these wonderfully
      moving poems, which include memories of Africa, personal and symbolic extensions
      of themes in conteporary science-fiction writing, and finally, her own intesely
      human reactions to everyday things . . . Home truths, and beautiful poetry"
